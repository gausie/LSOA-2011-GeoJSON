UK LSOA (2011) GeoJSON
======================

These GeoJSON data were produced from [Generalised and Clipped data from the 2011 census of England and Wales](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/Docs/Boundaries/Lower_layer_super_output_areas_(E+W)_2011_Boundaries_(Generalised_Clipped)_V2.zip). They were converted from a Shapefile using `ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON -t_srs crs:84`.
